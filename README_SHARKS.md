## Main goal  ðŸŽ£

To btain a clean, organized, null-free and legible data set that allows us to read and interpret the information we need and is relevant to us.


## Information 

The repository is divided in the following files:

- **Folder data:**

   - **attacks**: raw dataset.
   - **sharks_clean.csv**: dataset after cleaning.

- **Folder src:**

   - **main.ipynb**: this file is the playground.
   - **Limpieza de datos.ipynb**: the file where the cleaning methods are applied.
   - **VisualizaciÃ³n .ipynb**: this is the file to visualize the graphics, using seaborn, after cleaning the data. 

- **Folder img:**
   - the folder to save memes and graphs from the data analysis.
   
## Getting Started ðŸ“‚

**1. Objectives:**

**O1:** Surfing attacks by sex.

**O2:** Fatality cases by year.

**2. Cleaning:**

We will start by cleaning and filtering the relevant information from the Data Set. We have many columns that do not contain relevant information for our study, there are null columns, duplicates, incomplete data... we are going to be organized, cleaning and classifying the information that interests us!

**3.Data visualization and conlusions**

Here we will develop tables and graphs that will help us better see and understand the variables we need to understand our analysis.
